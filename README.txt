Ling Lu Dev. Site by Ling Lu 2016

The idea of making this site with Jekyll is because the github.io personal supports Jekyll.
This sites originally used Spectral theme template and meshed up to three other themes. Mesh up with three different themes is not fun and there is a lot of Scss and css code I need to change. But, it's a good chance for me to review my front-end skill.
